# Growing Tree
Generates a mesmerizing fractal using OpenFrameworks

## About the fractal
The fractal is drawn according to a simple rule:
On a square grid, start with a "plus sign" in the center. Then, iteratively add two branches to the end of any "open" branches.
If two branches meet, they become "closed" branches.
