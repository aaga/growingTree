## About the fractal
The fractal is drawn according to a simple rule:
On a square grid, start with a "plus sign" in the center. Then, iteratively add two branches to the end of any "open" branches.
If two branches meet, they become "closed" branches.

There is an option to animate and save frames, which can be stitched together to make a video.

Change the line length to make the fractal more or less "dense." Here are some sample outputs:
